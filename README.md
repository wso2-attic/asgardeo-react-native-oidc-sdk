## Introduction

Asgardeo's OIDC SDK for React Native allows mobile applications to use OIDC or OAuth2 authentication in a simple and secure way. By using Asgardeo and the React Native OIDC SDK, mobile application developers will be able to add identity management to their mobile applications with more ease.

## Install

Install the library from the npm registry.
```
npm install --save @asgardeo/auth-react-native
```

## Getting Started

You can experience the capabilities of Asgardeo React-native OIDC SDK by following this small guide which contains main
sections listed below.

- [Configuring the Identity Server](#configuring-the-identity-server)
- [Configuring the Sample](#configuring-the-sample)
- [Running the Sample App](#running-the-sample-app)
  - [Running in an Android Emulator](#running-in-an-android-emulator)
  - [Running in an Android Device](#running-in-an-android-device)

### Configuring the Identity Server

1.  Start the WSO2 Identity server. If you haven't downloaded yet, please visit https://wso2.com/identity-server/ and download the latest version of the Identity server.

2. Create a service provider/ application in WSO2 IS and configure it following one of the procedures mentioned below.

#### Approach 1

1.  Login to WSO2 IS management console from https://localhost:9443/carbon/ and navigate to the **Service Providers** tab listed under the **Identity** section.

      ![Management Console](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15249242/91068131-6fc2d380-e651-11ea-9d0a-d58c825bbb68.png)

2. Click **Add** to add a new service provider.

3. Provide a name for the Service Provider (ex:- sampleRN-app) and click **Register**. Now you will be redirected to the **Edit Service Provider** page.

4. Expand the **Inbound Authentication Configuration** section and click **Configure** under the **OAuth/OpenID Connect Configuration** section.

5. Under Allowed **Grant Types** uncheck everything except `Code` and `Refresh Token`.

6. Enter Callback URL(s) as for the following values.

   Callback Url: `wso2sample://oauth2`

> Alternatively if you're running in an emulator, you can use `http://10.0.2.2:8081` as the callback url.

7. Check **Allow authentication without the client secret**.

8. Click **Add** button to add the OAuth configurations.

9.  Once the configurations are added, you will be redirected to the **Service Provider Details** page. Here, expand the **Inbound Authentication Configuration** section and click on the **OAuth/OpenID Connect Configuration**. Copy the value of `OAuth Client Key` shown here.

    ![OAuth Client Credentials](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15249242/91567068-27155e00-e962-11ea-8eab-b3bdd790bfd4.png)

10. Make sure to click the `Update` button to save the changes.

#### Approach 2

Alternatively, you can create a **Custom Application** directly from the Identity Server Console.

1. Login to WSO2 IS console from https://localhost:9443/console/login and visit **Applications** section.

2. Click on **New Application** button and select the **Custom Application** template.

3. Provide a unique name to identify your application and click **Register** to complete the registration.

4. Go to the **Access** tab and click on **New Protocol** to start adding an authentication protocol.

5. Select **OpenID Connect** from the **Quick Setup** and click on **Next**.

6. Enter the Callback URL(s) as mentioned above and click **Next**.

7. Click **Finish** to save the configurations.

8. Under **Allowed grant type** check `Code` and `Refresh Token`.

9. Check **Public client** to allow the client to authenticate without a client secret.

10. Copy the value of `Client ID`. Make sure to click `Update` button to save the configurations.

### Configuring the Sample

1. Clone/download this project from `https://github.com/asgardeo/asgardeo-react-native-oidc-sdk.git`.

2. Install the dependencies and generate the tar file by running the following command inside the `lib/` directory.

   ```
   npm pack
   ```

3. Add the relevant configuratons to the **LoginScreen** file located at `sample/screen/LoginScreen` folder.

   - Replace the value of `clientID` with the value of `OAuth Client Key` or `Client ID` which you copied in the previous section of the documentation ([configuring the Identity Server](#configuring-the-identity-server)).

      ```TypeScript
      const config = {
         serverOrigin: 'https://{hostname}:9443',
         signInRedirectURL: 'http://{hostname}:{port}',
         clientID: 'ClientID',
         SignOutURL: "http://{hostname}:{port}"  // (Optional)
      };
      ```

      Example:

      ```TypeScript
      const config = {
         serverOrigin: 'https://10.0.2.2:9443',
         signInRedirectURL: 'wso2sample://oauth2',
         clientID: 'iMc7TiIaIFafkd5hA5xf7kGiAWUa',
         SignOutURL: "http://10.0.2.2:8081"  // (Optional)
      };
      ```

4. Install the required dependencies by running the following command inside the `sample/` directory.

   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Sample App

This application can be run either in an emulator or an actual device. Some configurations may differ depending on the OS.

### Android Setup

1. If the WSO2 IS is hosted in the local machine, you have to change the domain of the endpoints defined in `config` object at `screen/LoginScreen` file to `10.0.2.2`. Refer the documentation on [emulator-networking](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-networking). Next change the hostname of Identity server as `10.0.2.2` in the `<IS_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml` file.

2. By default IS uses a self-signed certificate. If you ended up in SSL issues and are using the default pack without changing to a CA signed certificate, follow this [guide](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-config) to get rid of SSL issues.

3. Sometimes you may get `SSLHandshakeException` in android application since WSO2 IS is using a self-signed certificate. To fix this exception, you need to add the public certificate of IS to the sample application.

   i. Create a new keystore with CN as localhost and SAN as `10.0.2.2`.

   ```
   keytool -genkey -alias wso2carbon -keyalg RSA -keystore wso2carbon.jks -keysize 2048 -ext SAN=IP:10.0.2.2
   ```

   ii. Export the public certificate (ex: `wso2carbon.pem`) to add into the truststore.

   ```
   keytool -exportcert -alias wso2carbon -keystore wso2carbon.jks -rfc -file wso2carbon.pem
   ```

   iii. Import the certificate in the client-truststore.jks file located in `<IS_HOME>/repository/resources/security/`.

   ```
   keytool -import -alias wso2is -file wso2carbon.pem -keystore client-truststore.jks -storepass wso2carbon
   ```

   iv. Now copy this public certificate (`wso2carbon.pem`) to the `app/src/main/res/raw` folder.

   v. Create a new file named `network_security_config.xml` in `sample/android/app/src/main/res/xml` folder and copy the below content to it. Make sure to replace `wso2carbon` with the certificate name you added.
   
   ```xml
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
      <network-security-config>
         <domain-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="true">
            <domain includeSubdomains="true">localhost</domain>
            <domain includeSubdomains="true">10.0.2.2</domain>
               <trust-anchors>
                     <certificates src="@raw/wso2carbon"/>
               </trust-anchors>
            <domain includeSubdomains="true">192.168.43.29</domain>
            <base-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="true"/>
         </domain-config>
      </network-security-config>
   ```

   vi. Then add the following config to the `sample/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file under `application` section.

   ```xml
   android:networkSecurityConfig="@xml/network_security_config"
   ```

   Now the `AndroidManifest.xml` file should look like below.
   ```xml
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
      <manifest ... >
         <application
           android:networkSecurityConfig="@xml/network_security_config"
           ...
         >
            ...
         </application>
      </manifest>
   ```

#### Running in an Android Emulator

1. Create a suitable Android virtual device using the **Android virtual device manager (AVD Manager)** and launch it.

2. Build and deploy the apps by running the following command at the root directory.

   ```bash
   react-native run-android
   ```

#### Running in an Android Device

1. Enable **Debugging over USB** and plug in your device via USB.

2. Build and deploy the apps by running the following command at the root directory.

   ```bash
   react-native run-android
   ```

> If you're running in a development or debugging mode, start the Metro by running the following command.

```bash
react-native start
```

## APIs

### AuthProvider

This is a React Context Provider that provides the session state that contains information such as the authenticated user's display name, email address, etc., and the methods that are required to implement authentication in the React native app.
Like every other provider, the `AuthProvider` also encapsulates the components that would need the data provided by the provider.

---

### useAuthContext

This is a React hook that returns the session state that contains information such as the email address of the authenticated user and the methods that are required for implementing authentication.

#### Example

```typescript
const { state, initialize, signIn } = useAuthContext();
```

The object returned by the `useAuthContext` has a `state` attribute the value of which is an object of type [`AuthStateInterface`](#AuthStateInterface). You can refer the link to know more about what data is contained by the `state` object.

In addition to the `state` object, the hook also returns the following methods.

---

### initialize

```TypeScript
initialize: (config: AuthClientConfig) => Promise<void>;
```

#### Arguments

1. config: [`AuthClientConfig`](https://github.com/asgardeo/asgardeo-auth-js-sdk#authclientconfigt) The config object containing the attributes that can be used to configure the SDK. To learn more about the available attributes, refer to [`AuthClientConfig`](https://github.com/asgardeo/asgardeo-auth-js-sdk#authclientconfigt) model.

#### Description

This method initializes the auth client with the config data.

#### Example

```TypeScript
const config = {
    clientID: 'iMc7TiIaIFafkd5hA5xf7kGiAWUa',
    serverOrigin: 'https://10.0.2.2:9443',
    signInRedirectURL: 'wso2sample://oauth2'
};

await initialize(config);
```

---

### getDataLayer

```TypeScript
getDataLayer: () => Promise<DataLayer<any>>;
```

#### Returns

dataLayer: [`DataLayer`](https://github.com/asgardeo/asgardeo-auth-js-sdk#data-layer)

A `DataLayer` object which wraps the `Store` object passed during object instantiation and provides access to various types of data used by the SDK. To learn more about the various types of interfaces provide by the `DataLayer`, refer to the [Data layer](https://github.com/asgardeo/asgardeo-auth-js-sdk#data-layer).

#### Description

This method returns DataLayer objects used by the SDK to store authentication data.

#### Example

```TypeScript
const _dataLayer = await getDataLayer();
```

---

### getAuthorizationURL

```TypeScript
getAuthorizationURL: (config?: GetAuthURLConfig) => Promise<string>;
```

#### Arguments

1. config: [`GetAuthURLConfig`](https://github.com/asgardeo/asgardeo-auth-js-sdk#getauthurlconfig) (optional) Config object that has the necessary attributes to configure this method. The `forceInit` attribute can be set to `true` to trigger a request to the `.well-known` endpoint and obtain the OIDC endpoints. By default, a request to the `.well-known` endpoint will be sent only if a request to it had not been sent before. If you wish to force a request to the endpoint, you can use this attribute.

   The object can only contain key-value pairs that you wish to append as path parameters to the authorization URL. For example, to set the `fidp` parameter, you can insert `fidp` as a key and its value to this object.

#### Description

This method returns a Promise that resolves with the authorization URL. The user can be redirected to this URL to authenticate themselves and authorize the client.

#### Example

```TypeScript
getAuthorizationURL(config).then((url) => {
     Linking.openURL(url);
}).catch((error) => {
     console.error(error);
});
```

---

### signIn

```TypeScript
signIn: () => Promise<void>;
```

#### Description

As the name implies, this method is used to sign-in users. This method will work in two phases. The first phase generates the authorization url and takes the user to the single-sign-on page of the identity server, while second phase triggers the token request to complete the authentication process. So, this method should be called when the user clicks on the **Sign in** button and should listen for the authentication state for state update inorder to proceed with the signin.

#### Example

```TypeScript
signIn()
    .catch((error: any) => {
        console.log(error);
    });


useEffect(() => {
    // Steps after the authentication should come here.
    ...
}, [ state.isAuthenticated ]);
